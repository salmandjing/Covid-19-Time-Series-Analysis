#Project Title: Analyzing the Effectiveness of Preventative Measures in regard to COVID-19 

#Project Mentor: Dr. Bo Li 

#Researchers: Chidinma Iheanyi-Okeahialam and Salman Djingueinabaye 

##Brief Summary of Project: Our goal in this project is to analyze the effects of mask mandates and executive orders (I.e., stay at home orders) issued in regard to COVID-19 in 6 counties/cities to determine if there is an association between their implementation and infection and death rates related to COVID-19. The intention is to evaluate the effective of these preventative measures in limiting the spread of COVID-19.
